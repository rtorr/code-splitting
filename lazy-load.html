  <h1>Lazy Loading</h1>
  <p>With the lazy loading approach, we have a set of options available for optimzing this code.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bundle all modules into one file</li>
    <li>Minfy each file and reques them when needed</li>
  </ul>
  <p>So, think about this in the context of ember engines, for example.
    We will have our main bundle (the containing ember app), and an ember engine.
    We can load the engine only when we need it. We will however, get the full
    ember engine, even if we are using all of it for a given task. Think of it task
    one kitchen sink loading another kitchen sink.
